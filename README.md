- 👋 Hi, I’m @kspr9
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills in coding and data. I have a background in renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development, but wanted to switch into something more location independent + I've always been interested in computers and coding, just oldschool OS based native programming seemed too much hassle. Now that we have eg. Django etc and web apps are a decent alternative to OS natives, I see that path really potential to me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, linux, bash, Django, SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well anything related to things above. I'd also be interested combining coding and my previous professional background.
- 📫 How to reach me ... --> kaspar9@pm.me
