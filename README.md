- 👋 Hi, I’m @kspr9
- 👀 I’m a freelance ICT consultant working with digitization, tokenization and web3. I have a background in renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development, but I've always been interested in computers and coding. My recent project involves Web3 smart contracts and asset backed tokens.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with >> Svelte, TS/JS, smartpy, Python, linux, bash, Django, SQL/postgres
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well anything related to things above. I'd also be interested combining coding and my previous professional background.
- 📫 How to reach me ... --> kspr9@pm.me
